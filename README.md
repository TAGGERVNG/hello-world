# hello-world
a first go


hello there! my name is tag and all this stuff is super new to me. i haven't been much with creating things on computers but rather fixing things as tech support for the last several years, and now i want to make my own mistakes to fix. i don't really understand much past html or css yet but i'm having fun with javascript for now.
